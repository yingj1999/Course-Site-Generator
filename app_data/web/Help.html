        <p>Course Site Generator is a desktop Java application for creating a course's 
            website. The app presents 5 tabs, each of which either modifies the data found on the course website or 
            the style of the website. The data will all be stored in json files, which will then de read and displayed 
            in a html web file. The styles and images will be found in the image dir and the css file. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Choose Tab you wish to work with</h3>
        
        <p>To start, determine what part of the website you would like to change and pick that pane<br /><br /></p>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Modify Data</h3>
        
        <p>Choose correct section and modify data or style<br /><br />
        </p>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Save and export changes</h3>
        
        <p>Once you've completed your work, you can press the save button and 
            give your file a name. Note that the name
            in the app text field will be the name used in the Recent Work list
            of the Welcome dialog.<br /><br /></p>
